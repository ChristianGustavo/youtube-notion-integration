# **Youtube & Notion**

The idea of this project is to search for a **YouTube** channel, select a playlist from this channel and create a `page` on **Notion** with the playlist link as a `bookmark` and each video as a `to_do` (checkbox).

You can use it to keep track of playlists for study, games or anything you want. :)
